If you were to create a config file called `starnet_2.ini` in Step 1, this model could be trained by running `python train_starnet.py starnet_2 -v 1000 -ct 5.00` which will train your model displaying the progress every 1000 batch iterations and the model would be saved every 5 minutes. This same command will continue training the network if you already have the model saved in the [model directory](./models) from previous training iterations.\n",

This will launch one 3-hour job on the GPU nodes to finish the training. You can checkout the other parameters that can be changed with the command `python cc/launch_starnet.py -h`.\n",
